    "The easiest way to get to Żelazowa Wola is by train to Sochaczew,
    then MZK bus from (bus stop at Sochaczew PKP train station). Bus number 6 – alight at the last stop.<br />
    Bus tickets: normal 3 zlotys, concessionary 2 zlotys."

            Like I posted previously, the tourist information center recommended to use tourist service.<br />
            I was stubborn to choose public transportation. I learned the reason for her recommendation.<br />
            So I went to the Central Sta. showed the ticket counter a memo with Sochaczew, got ticket for 19zł. There was 11:00am train.<br /><br />
            Now, I would like an attention from all train-spoiled Japanese or car-life Americans,
            <br />or anyone who do not know MANUAL operating door of trains.<br /><br />
            When I got Sochaczew sta. I could not open this. <br />
            Luckily, I saw a lady coming in in the next train, so I asked her to show how to open it. Dzięnkuję!!

    Now that I got out of the station, there was a bus stop, but the timetable was something like this:<br />
    8:00| 9:00 | 10:30| 11:00|14:00|15:00 ... ( Disclaimer: Not accurate copy. Please do not rely on this information for your trip! )

<div>
    It was close to 11:45am. I decided to approach one of the taxi cab and showing the memo of "Żelazawa Wola, Chopin Museum":
    <br />"Dzien Dobre, Ile to Kosztuje? (Hello, How much?)  He said 40zł, in English, while showing his four finger. Ok. Good. <br />
    <br />I asked him to take there.
</div>
<div>
    As soon as I got off the taxi, I went to the bus station and took a note of the timetable.<br />
    Next bus bound for Sochaczew station was 14:25pm. <br />
    The 2 timetables on the board had no English, so I look for just "Sochaczew", and wrote down both of the time table on my notepaper.<br />

            The Chopin's birth place has the little house, and also museum with display of folk instrument that plays Mazurka, Krakowiak etc. <br />
            There were bugpipes, and flute, and a instrument of some convination of violin and keyboard. I took a note "SieSienki" and "Mazanki".<br />
            The birthplace house is pretty small but cozy.<br />
            There is old piano for displaying Chopin's friends piano (likely Chopin played sometime), and working piano with outdoor seating.<br />
            I think that piano was for the weekend concert.

    The garden was well-maintained, and has plenty of water current, bridge and flower.<br />
    I could not help thinking when infant Chopin spent his 8 months of life here, the place should not have been this tidy and organized,
    <br /> and thought about more organic/natural version of the garden.

            After lunch in the cafe inside of the garden, I went back to the bus station. There were a couple of lady and gentleman sitting there,<br />
            I talked to them,  "Dzien Dobre, Czy jest autobus do Schacew?" They replyed "What?" in Enlglish. <br />
            Yay, I met English speaking tourist folks!<br />
            We started talking about how to go back to Warsaw, and itinerary. They were from Rome, <br />
            and they apparently had the same kind of itinerary as mine.They went to Chopin Museum the day before,
            <br /> and also they planned to go to Krakow in the next day. Also the gentleman was a pianist.<br />
            We talked about the trip, living country and piano playing, then exchanged facebook info.<br />

    In the bus, I gave my seat to an elder lady. She showed me her appreciation, palm together,<br />
    started to talk to me. However, I could not understand what she was saying at all. <br />
    I heard a bit of "Gdzie jest... " (Where) So, I said "Sochaczew" But she showed unsure expression.
    <br />Maybe she asked me where I came from, or where I am staying etc. I wish I could understand Polish more.
    <br /> I really would like to be able to have simple conversation at least by the time I come back next year.

    Yes, unlike Warsaw, people do not speak English in Żelazawa Wola area,  just the same comparison Tokyo vs my hometown in Japan. <br />
    Żelazawa Wola is located in suburb, and granted things are different from the city.

    I think this was the first time eating rabbit for me. Rabbit teasted like a white meat fish, with chicken texture.<br />
    Yes, that was really yummy. Polish meal is not too salty, dishes are not too big,<br />
    and chicken taste like chicken and vegetables taste like real vegetable! (comparing to  U.S.)
