            Since Chopin Museums are closed on Monday, I decided to visit the spots related to Chopin, in old town.

            Arriving old town in Warsaw using Tram (at this day, I got a day pass for 15złoty, I walked toward the
            first destination; <a href="http://www.honoratka.com.pl/" target="_blank" class="contents">Honoratka</a>,
            which is a cafe in fashion at the time of chopin's day, still in business.

        <div style="display:table-cell;width:50%;left:0;display:table-cell; vertical-align:bottom;">
            The Cafe did not seem to be open yet, so I just walked around  between charming traditional style housings.

        Me: "Why Polish traditional building have official entrance, and small door right next to it?"<br />
        My friend who has polish spouse: "My wife said that in the old days, coal as used to heat houses and coal was delivered through those small doors to a steam room :)"

    Went around the old town, sewing between tiny organic pathways,
    I ended up with coming back to the the open area close to Tram station.
    I found a gentleman with white wig, almost like a Bach cosplay...
    is passing flyer. He passed me the flyer, saying "English side", indicating flyers flip side is English ...
    its a flyer for his pipe organ concert in 20min in St. Anne. Why not. I decided go in. The ticket was 10złoty.

    After the concert, I went back to Honoratoka. I ordered Zurek, and ... ah,
    "Domowe Pierogiz miesem lub Kapustai grzybami" --- mushroom and cabbage dumpling
    ( just jot down in my note from the menu, likely being misspelled)

    Listening Chopin music in a place with low ceiling, I really wanted to spend there hours. Soooo cosy.

    When I check out, I found myself not knowing the tip system. With awkwardness, I asked the waitress about it, and it is Only Cash.
    Also, I could ask "Gdzie jest toaleta?"(= Where is bathroom?)  to her.  I love when my terrible foregin language somewhat communicate with the local people!

            Walked down the street to south, I reached Saski park, where has an eternal fire with the "Tomb of unknown soldiers"
            is protected by two guard. I am impressed people pay respect to the people who dedicated to big cause, rather than big names.

        <div class="wrap" style="width:50%; display:table-cell;vertical-align:top;">
            On the other hand, I really would like to know the name of this bird; They look like avarage out of crow + dove + seagull.
            <br />(Edit: Later, my friend told me the name of the bird. It is "Hooded Crow") <br /><br />
            Why ? because THEY POOPED ON ME.

        <li>Dogs are off-leash, though they are royal to owner, walking close.</li>
        <li>The check out register do not have auto-drawer like Japan or U.S. Shops have money box to keep changes.</li>
        <li>Smoking & walking :/</li>
